    <p>Korean dramas differ from a lot of Western TV content, as they are typically only made to last for one season, with one overarching plot lasting 12 to 16 or so episodes. Historical stories and sitcoms may last longer, even up to 200 episodes, but the majority of prime-time television is set up this way. The dramas range on a variety of topics, from history and action to school and work life.</p>

The most common ingredients to use for cooking are 된장 (doenjang) which is a fermented bean paste, ginger, chili powder, fermented hot pepper paste, garlic, salt, sesame oil, and soy sauce.In general, Koreans eat a lot of rice, vegetables, and meats. It’s typical for each meal to consist of multiple different side dishes, called 반찬 (banchan), in addition to the main course. Of them, kimchi is the staple side dish present at every meal.</p>
